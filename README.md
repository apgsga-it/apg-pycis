# apg-pycis

Python scripts, which support the Jenkins/Maven/Gradle CI Process (Apg Python CI Scripts)

The script has a interactive and non interactive modus. The latter intended for automated processes.

The interfactive modus creates interactively a configuration file "config.ini" which is stored for later usage in "~/.apg_pycis"
Interactively one can stop the processing after the configuration file has been established.

The non interactive modus, presumes a valid "~/.apg_pycis/config.ini" file.

TODO

## Open Issues
